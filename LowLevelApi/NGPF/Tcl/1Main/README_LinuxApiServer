# To support ixNet low level API against the Linux API server:
#
#   Get IxTclNetwork.tcl:   
#       - Version from 8.0 up to 8.40, you need to download the IxTclNetwork package from the Linux API server.
#       - On a web browser, enter the IP address of your Linux API server.
#       - Login admin/admin.
#       - Click on "Download A Client"
#
#   - The problem is that the IxTclNetwork is the same file name as the installed IxNetwork file in the lib directory.
#   - You don't want to overwrite the existing file.  Ixia is addressing this issue on the next release.
#   - Below is a way to handle the filename conflict.
#
#   - After you downloaded the IxTclNetwork.py file, untar it.
#   - Put it in the Ixia installation folder: /ixia/ixnetwork/8.40.1124.8/lib/IxTclNetwork and rename it to LinuxApiServer:
#          Example: /ixia/ixnetwork/8.40.1124.8/lib/IxTclNetwork/LinuxApiServer
#   - Go into the LinuxApiServer folder and:
#       - Rename IxTclNetwork to IxTclNetworkLinuxApiServer.tcl
#       - Edit pkgIndex.tcl
#       
#           set env(IXTCLNETWORK_8.40.1124.8) [file dirname [info script]]
# 
#           package ifneeded IxTclNetworkLinuxApiServer 8.40.1124.8 {
#           package provide IxTclNetworkLinuxApiServer 8.40.1124.8
#           source [file join $env(IXTCLNETWORK_8.40.1124.8) LinuxApiServer/IxTclNetworkLinuxApiServer.tcl]
#           source [file join $env(IXTCLNETWORK_8.40.1124.8) LinuxApiServer/HighLevelAPI.tcl]
#
#    - Install ActiveTcl to get the tls and http packages because the Linux API server requires it.
#    - Add tls and http paths to TCLLIBPATH:
#
#         export linuxApiServer=${ixTclNetwork}/LinuxApiServer
#         export tclTls=/opt/ActiveTcl-8.5/./lib/teapot/package/linux-glibc2.3-x86_64/lib/tls1.6.4
#         export tclHttp=/opt/ActiveTcl-8.5/lib/tcl8.5/http1.0
#         export TCLLIBPATH="$IXOS_API_HOME $HLT_HOME $HLT_LIBRARY ${IXLOAD_HOME}/lib $ixLoadComm $ixTclNetwork $linuxApiServer $tclTls $tclHttp"
# 
#    - Add ActiveTcl to .bashrc PATH
#         export PATH="/opt/ActiveTcl-8.5/bin:/usr/local/git-2.15.1/libexec/git-core:/usr/local/python3.6.3/bin:$PATH"
#
#    - In the scripts, package req IxTclNetworkLinuxApiServer

# The original Linux API Server file is IxTclNetwork, but it is renamed to IxTclNetworkLinuxApiServer
# to support both Windows and Linux. Rename this to IxTclNetwork if that's what you're using.
# Using this assumes that you are using the Linux all-in-one tar package downloaded from the OpenIxia.com/softwareUpgrade.
